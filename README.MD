# FilmHelg
School project together with class "informationsproduktion" (IP). 
Assignment was to create an imaginary event-page for an existing company. (Filmstaden in our case)

The project uses Tailwind for styling and browserify, postCSS and a costum html-minifier for bundling and minification. 
The site is live on netlify: https://filmhelg.netlify.app
